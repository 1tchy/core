  <para>Because Web Beans is so new, there's not yet a lot of information
  available online.</para>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  
  <para>Of course, the Web Beans specification is the best source of more
  information about Web Beans. The spec is about 100 pages long, only 
  twice the length of this article, and almost as readable. But, of course, 
  it covers many details that we've skipped over. The spec is available 
  from <literal>http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299</literal>.</para>
  
  <para>The Web Beans Reference implementation is being developed at
  <literal>http://seamframework.org/WebBeans</literal>. The RI development
  team and the Web Beans spec lead blog at <literal>http://in.relation.to</literal>.
  This article is substantially based upon a series of blog entries published
  there.</para>
