  <para>The third theme of Web Beans is <emphasis>integration</emphasis>. Web
  Beans was designed to work in concert with other technologies, helping the 
  application developer fit the other technologies together. Web Beans is an 
  open technology. It forms a part of the Java EE ecosystem, and is itself the 
  foundation for a new ecosystem of portable extensions and integration with 
  existing frameworks and technologies.</para>
  
  <para>We've already seen how Web Beans helps integrate EJB and JSF, allowing
  EJBs to be bound directly to JSF pages. That's just the beginning. Web Beans
  offers the same potential to diverse other technologies, such as Business
  Process Management engines, other Web Frameworks, and third-party component
  models. The Java EE platform will never be able to standardize all the
  interesting technologies that are used in the world of Java application
  development, but Web Beans makes it easier to use the technologies which are
  not yet part of the platform seamlessly within the Java EE environment.</para>
  
  <para>We're about to see how to take full advantage of the Java EE platform
  in an application that uses Web Beans. We'll also briefly meet a set of SPIs 
  that are provided to support portable extensions to Web Beans. You might not
  ever need to use these SPIs directly, but it's nice to know they are there if
  you need them. Most importantly, you'll take advantage of them indirectly, 
  every time you use a third-party extension.</para>
