Weld currently comes with a number of examples:

* jsf/numberguess (a war example for JSF)
* jsf/login (another war example for JSF)
* jsf/translator (an EJB example for JSF)
* se/numberguess (the numberguess example for Java SE using Swing)
* se/helloworld (a simple example for Java SE)
* wicket/numberguess (the numberguess example for Wicket)

Before running the examples, you'll need to ensure your
server supports Weld.

The examples and RI are explained in detail in the reference guide, including
how to deploy the examples to JBoss 5, and how to deploy the examples to Tomcat
