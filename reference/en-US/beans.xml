   <title>More about beans</title>
  
      <para>
         A bean is usually an application class that contains business logic. It may be called directly from Java code,
         or it may be invoked via the Unified EL. A bean may access transactional resources. Dependencies between beans
         are managed automatically by the container. Most beans are <emphasis>stateful</emphasis> and
         <emphasis>contextual</emphasis>. The lifecycle of a bean is always managed by the container.
      </para>

      <para>
         Let's back up a second. What does it really mean to be <emphasis>contextual</emphasis>? Since beans may be
         stateful, it matters <emphasis>which</emphasis> bean instance I have. Unlike a stateless component model (for
         example, stateless session beans) or a singleton component model (such as servlets, or singleton beans),
         different clients of a bean see the bean in different states. The client-visible state depends upon which
         instance of the bean the client has a reference to.
      </para> 

      <para>
         However, like a stateless or singleton model, but <emphasis>unlike</emphasis> stateful session beans, the
         client does not control the lifecycle of the instance by explicitly creating and destroying it. Instead, the
         <emphasis>scope</emphasis> of the bean determines:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>the lifecycle of each instance of the bean and</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>which clients share a reference to a particular instance of the bean.</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  
      <para>
         For a given thread in a CDI application, there may be an <emphasis>active context</emphasis> associated with
         the scope of the bean. This context may be unique to the thread (for example, if the bean is request scoped),
         or it may be shared with certain other threads (for example, if the bean is session scoped) or even all other
         threads (if it is application scoped).
      </para>

      <para>
         Clients (for example, other beans) executing in the same context will see the same instance of the bean. But
         clients in a different context may see a different instance (depending on the relationship between the
         contexts).
      </para>

      <para>
         One great advantage of the contextual model is that it allows stateful beans to be treated like services! The
         client need not concern itself with managing the lifecycle of the bean it's using, <emphasis>nor does it even
         need to know what that lifecycle is.</emphasis> Beans interact by passing messages, and the bean implementations
         define the lifecycle of their own state. The beans are loosely coupled because:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>they interact via well-defined public APIs</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>their lifecycles are completely decoupled</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         We can replace one bean with another different bean that implements the same interface and has a different lifecycle
         (a different scope) without affecting the other bean implementation. In fact, CDI defines a simple facility for
         overriding bean implementations at deployment time, as we will see in <xref linkend="alternatives"/>.
      </para>
  
      <para>
         Note that not all clients of a bean are beans themselves. Other objects such as servlets or message-driven
         beans&#8212;which are by nature not injectable, contextual objects&#8212;may also obtain references to beans by
         injection.

         <title>Bean types, qualifiers and dependency injection</title>

         <para>
            Beans usually acquire references to other beans via dependency injection. Any injected attribute specifies a
            "contract" that must be satisfied by the bean to be injected. The contract is:
         </para>

         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>a bean type, together with</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>a set of qualifiers.</para></listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>
            A bean type is a user-defined class or interface; a type that is client-visible. If the bean is an EJB
            session bean, the bean type is the <literal>@Local</literal> interface or bean-class local view. A bean may
            have multiple bean types. For example, the following bean has four bean types:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class BookShop 
      extends Business 
      implements Shop<Book> {
   ...
}]]></programlisting> 

         <para>  
            The bean types are <literal>BookShop</literal>, <literal>Business</literal> and
            <literal>Shop&lt;Book&gt;</literal>, as well as the implicit type <literal>java.lang.Object</literal>.
            (Notice that a parameterized type is a legal bean type). 
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Meanwhile, this session bean has only the local interfaces <literal>BookShop</literal>, 
            <literal>Auditable</literal> and <literal>java.lang.Object</literal> as bean types, since the bean class, 
            <literal>BookShopBean</literal> is not a client-visible type.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Stateful
public class BookShopBean 
      extends Business 
      implements BookShop, Auditable {
   ...
}]]></programlisting> 

         <note>
            <para>
               Most bean types you can probably figure out. One gotcha is primitive types. All primitive types are assumed
               to be identical to their corresponding wrapper types in <literal>java.lang</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            Bean types may be restricted to an explicit set by annotating the bean with the <literal>@Typed</literal>
            annotation and listing the classes that should be bean types. For instance, the bean types of this bean have 
            been restricted to <literal>Shop&lt;Book&gt;</literal>, together with <literal>java.lang.Object</literal>:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Typed(Shop.class)
public class BookShop 
      extends Business 
      implements Shop<Book> {
   ...
}]]></programlisting> 

         <para>
            Sometimes, a bean type alone does not provide enough information for the container to know which bean to inject.
            For instance, suppose we have two implementations of the <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> interface:
            <literal>CreditCardPaymentProcessor</literal> and <literal>DebitPaymentProcessor</literal>. Injecting a field of 
            type <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> introduces an ambiguous condition. In these cases, the client must 
            specify some additional quality of the implementation it is interested in. We model this kind of "quality" using
            a qualifier.
         </para>

         <para>
            A qualifier is a user-defined annotation that is itself annotated <literal>@Qualifer</literal>. A qualifier 
            annotation is an extension of the type system. It lets us disambiguate a type without having to fall back to 
            string-based names. Here's an example of a qualifier annotation:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, PARAMETER, FIELD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface CreditCard {}]]></programlisting> 

         <para>
            You may not be used to seeing the definition of an annotation. In fact, this might be the first time you've
            encountered one. With CDI, annotation definitions will become a familiar artifact as you'll be creating them 
            from time to time. 
         </para>
         
         <tip>
            <para>
               Pay attention to the names of the built-in annotations in CDI and EJB. You'll notice that they are 
               often adjectives. We encourage you to follow this convention when creating your custom annotations, 
               since they serve to describe the behaviors and roles of the class.
            </para>
         </tip>
            
         <para>
            Now that we have defined a qualifier annotation, we can use it to disambiguate an injection point. The 
            following injection point has the bean type <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> and qualifier 
            <literal>@CreditCard</literal>:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @CreditCard PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor]]></programlisting>

         <note>
            <para>
               If an injection point does not explicitly specify a qualifier, it has the default qualifier, 
               <literal>@Default</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            For each injection point, the container searches for a bean which satisfies the contract, one which has
            the bean type and all the qualifiers. If it finds exactly one matching bean, it injects an instance of 
            that bean. If it doesn't, it reports an error to the user.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            How do we specify that qualifiers of a bean? By annotating the bean class, of course! The following bean 
            has the qualifier <literal>@CreditCard</literal> and implements the bean type <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal>. 
            Therefore, it satisfies our qualified injection point:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@CreditCard
public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor 
    implements PaymentProcessor { ... }]]></programlisting>

         <note>
            <para>
               If a bean does not explicitly specify a qualifier, it has the default qualifier, <literal>@Default</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>
         
         <!-- 
         <note>
            <para>
               All beans have the qualifier, <literal>@Any</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>
         -->
         
         <para>
            That's not quite the end of the story. CDI also defines a simple <emphasis>resolution rule</emphasis> that helps 
            the container decide what to do if there is more than one bean that satisfies a particular contract. We'll get 
            into the details in <xref linkend="injection"/>.
         </para>
         
         <!--
         <tip>
            <para>
               If you're expectng more than one bean to satisfy the contract, you can inject an <literal>Instance</literal>,
               object which let's you iterate over all the beans which satisfy the contract. For example, we can iterate
               over all our implementations of <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> using:
            </para>
            <programlisting>@Inject void init(@Any Instance&lt;PaymentProcessor&gt; paymentProcessorInstance) {
    for (PaymentProcessor pp: paymentProcessorInstance) { ... }
}</programlisting>
         </tip>

      </section>

      <section>
         <title>Scope</title>
         <!-- I wonder whether the explaination of contextual above would fit better here -->

         <para>
            The <emphasis>scope</emphasis> of a bean defines the lifecycle and visibility of its instances.
            The CDI context model is extensible, accommodating arbitrary scopes. However, certain important scopes are
            built into the specification, and provided by the container. Each scope is represented by an annotation
            type.
         </para>

         <para>
            For example, any web application may have <emphasis>session scoped</emphasis> bean:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @SessionScoped
class ShoppingCart implements Serializable { ... }]]></programlisting>

         <para>An instance of a session-scoped bean is bound to a user session
  and is shared by all requests that execute in the context of that session.</para>

         <note>
            <para>
               Keep in mind that once a bean is bound to a context, it remains in that context until the context is
               destroyed. There is no way to manually remove a bean from a context. If you don't want the bean to sit 
               in the session indefinitely, consider using another scope with a shorted lifespan, such as the request 
               or conversation scope.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            If a scope is not explicitly specified, then the bean belongs to a special scope called the
            <emphasis>dependent pseudo-scope</emphasis>. Beans with this scope live to serve the object into which they
            were injected, which means their lifecycle is bound to the lifecycle of that object.
         </para>

         <para>We'll talk more about scopes in <xref linkend="scopescontexts"/>.</para>

      </section>

      <section>
         <title>EL name</title>

         <para>
            If you want to reference a bean in non-Java code that supports Unified EL expressions, for example, in a 
            JSP or JSF page, you must assign the bean an <emphasis>EL name</emphasis>.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The EL name is specified using the <literal>@Named</literal> annotation, as shown here:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @SessionScoped @Named("cart")
class ShoppingCart implements Serializable { ... }]]></programlisting>

         <para>Now we can easily use the bean in any JSF or JSP page:</para>

         <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<h:dataTable value="#{cart.lineItems}" var="item">
   ...
</h:dataTable>]]></programlisting>

         <note>
            <para>
               The <literal>@Named</literal> annotation is not what makes the class a bean. Most classes in a bean
               archive are already recognized as beans. The <literal>@Named</literal> annotation just makes it
               possible to reference the bean from the EL, most commonly from a JSF view.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            We can let CDI choose a name for us by leaving off the value of the <literal>@Named</literal> annotation:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @SessionScoped @Named
class ShoppingCart implements Serializable { ... }]]></programlisting>

         <para>
            The name defaults to the unqualified class name, decapitalized; in this case,
            <literal>shoppingCart</literal>.
         </para>

      reader needs to feel confident than they would know how to create an alternative and enable it. -->
      <section>
         <title>Alternatives</title>

         <para>
            We've already seen how qualifiers let us choose between multiple implementations of an interface 
            at development time. But sometimes we have an interface (or other bean type) whose implementation 
            varies depending upon the deployment environment. For example, we may want to use a mock 
            implementation in a testing environment. An <emphasis>alternative</emphasis> may be declared by 
            annotating the bean class with the <literal>@Alternative</literal> annotation.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @Alternative
class MockPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessorImpl { ... }]]></programlisting> 
         
         <para>
            We normally annotate a bean <literal>@Alternative</literal> only when there is some other
            implementation of an interface it implements (or of any of its bean types). We can choose between 
            alternatives at deployment time by <emphasis>selecting</emphasis> an alternative in the CDI 
            deployment descriptor <literal>META-INF/beans.xml</literal> of the jar or Java EE module that uses 
            it. Different modules can specify that they use different alternatives.

      <section>
         <title>Interceptor binding types</title>

         <para>
            You might be familiar with the use of interceptors in EJB 3.0. In Java EE 6, this functionality has
            been generalized to work with other managed beans. That's right, you no longer have to make your bean 
            an EJB just to intercept its methods. Holler. So what does CDI have to offer above and beyond that? Well, 
            quite a lot actually. Let's cover some background.
         </para>

         <para>
            The way that interceptors were defined in Java EE 5 was counter-intuitive. You were required to specify the
            <emphasis>implementation</emphasis> of the interceptor directly on the <emphasis>implementation</emphasis>
            of the EJB, either in the <literal>@Interceptors</literal> annotation or in the XML descriptor. You might as
            well just put the interceptor code <emphasis>in</emphasis> the implementation! Second, the order in which
            the interceptors are applied is taken from the order in which they are declared in the annotation or the XML
            descriptor. Perhaps this isn't so bad if you're applying the interceptors to a single bean. But, if you are
            applying them repeatedly, then there's a good chance that you'll inadvertently define a different order for 
            different beans. Now that's a problem.
         </para>

         <para>
            CDI provides a new approach to binding interceptors to beans that introduces a level of indirection (and
            thus control). We must define an <emphasis>interceptor binding type</emphasis> to describe the behavior 
            implemented by the interceptor.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            An interceptor binding type is a user-defined annotation that is itself annotated <literal>@InterceptorBinding</literal>.
            It lets us bind interceptor classes to bean classes with no direct dependency between the two classes.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@InterceptorBinding
@Inherited
@Target( { TYPE, METHOD })
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Transactional {}]]></programlisting>

         <para>
           The interceptor that implements transaction management declares this annotation: 
         </para>
         
         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @Transactional @Interceptor
class TransactionInterceptor { ... }]]></programlisting>
         
         <para>
            We can apply the interceptor to a bean by annotating the bean class with the same interceptor binding type:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public @SessionScoped @Transactional
class ShoppingCart implements Serializable { ... }]]></programlisting>

         <para>
            Notice that <literal>ShoppingCart</literal> and <literal>TransactionInterceptor</literal> don't know 
            anything about each other.
         </para>

         <para>
            Interceptors are deployment-specific. (We don't need a <literal>TransactionInterceptor</literal> in our
            unit tests!) By default, an interceptor is disabled. We can enable an interceptor using the CDI deployment 
            descriptor <literal>META-INF/beans.xml</literal> of the jar or Java EE module. This is also where we
            specify the interceptor ordering.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            We'll discuss interceptors, and their cousins, decorators, in <xref linkend="interceptors"/> and <xref

         We've already seen two types of beans: JavaBeans and EJB session beans. Is that the whole story? Actually,

            A managed bean is a Java class. The basic lifecycle and semantics of a managed bean are defined by the 
            Managed Beans specification. You can explicitly declare a managed bean by annotating the bean class
            <literal>@ManagedBean</literal>, but in CDI you don't need to. According to the specification, the CDI 
            container treats any class that satisfies the following conditions as a managed bean:

            Session beans are also, technically, managed beans. However, since they have their own special lifecycle and 
            take advantage of additional enterprise services, the CDI specification considers them to be a different
            kind of bean.

         <title>Session beans</title>

         <para>
            Session beans belong to the EJB specification. They have a special lifecycle, state management and concurrency
            model that is different to other managed beans and non-managed Java objects. But session beans participate in 
            CDI just like any other bean. You can inject one session bean into another session bean, a managed bean into a 
            session bean, a session bean into a managed bean, have a managed bean observe an event raised by a session bean, 
            and so on.

               Message-driven and entity beans are by nature non-contextual objects and may not be injected into other
               objects. However, message-driven beans can take advantage of some CDI functionality, such as dependency 
               injection, interceptors and decorators. In fact, CDI will perform injection into any session or 
               message-driven bean, even those which are not contextual instances.

         </note>

         <para>
            The unrestricted set of bean types for a session bean contains all local interfaces of the bean and their
            superinterfaces. If the session bean has a bean class local view, the unrestricted set of bean types
            contains the bean class and all superclasses. In addition, <literal>java.lang.Object</literal> is a bean
            type of every session bean. But remote interfaces are <emphasis>not</emphasis> included in the set of bean
            types.
         </para>

         <para>There's no reason to explicitly declare the scope of a stateless session bean or singleton session bean. 
         The EJB container controls the lifecycle of these beans, according to the semantics of the <literal>@Stateless</literal>
         or <literal>@Singleton</literal> declaration. On the other hand, a stateful session bean may have any scope.</para>
         
         <para>
            Stateful session beans may define a <emphasis>remove method</emphasis>, annotated <literal>@Remove</literal>, 
            that is used by the application to indicate that an instance should be destroyed. However, for a contextual 
            instance of the bean&#8212;an instance under the control of CDI&#8212;this method may only be called by the 
            application if the bean has scope <literal>@Dependent</literal>. For beans with other scopes, the application 
            must let the container destroy the bean.
         </para>

            So, when should we use a session bean instead of a plain managed bean? Whenever we need the advanced enterprise
            services offered by EJB, such as:

            <listitem>
              <para>timers and asynchronous methods,</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
       
         <para>When we don't need any of these things, an ordinary managed bean will serve just fine.</para>
       
         <para>
            Many beans (including any <literal>@SessionScoped</literal> or <literal>@ApplicationScoped</literal> 
            beans) are available for concurrent access. Therefore, the concurrency management provided by EJB 3.1 
            is especially useful. Most session and application scoped beans should be EJBs.
         </para>
       
         <para>
            Beans which hold references to heavy-weight resources, or hold a lot of internal state benefit from the
            advanced container-managed lifecycle defined by the EJB stateless/stateful/singleton model, with its
            support for passivation and instance pooling.
         </para>
       
         <para>
            Finally, it's usually obvious when method-level transaction management, method-level security, timers,
            remote methods or asynchronous methods are needed.
         </para>

         <para>
            The point we're trying to make is: use a session bean when you need the services it provides, not just 
            because you want to use dependency injection, lifecycle management, or interceptors. Java EE 6 provides
            a graduated programming model. It's usually easy to start with an ordinary managed bean, and later turn 
            it into an EJB just by adding one of the following annotations: <literal>@Stateless</literal>, 
            <literal>@Stateful</literal> or <literal>@Singleton</literal>.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            On the other hand, don't be scared to use session beans just because you've heard your friends say 
            they're "heavyweight". It's nothing more than superstition to think that something is "heavier" just 
            because it's hosted natively within the Java EE container, instead of by a proprietary bean container 
            or dependency injection framework that runs as an additional layer of obfuscation. And as a general
            principle, you should be skeptical of folks who use vaguely defined terminology like "heavyweight".

         <title>Producer methods</title>
   
         <para>
            Not everything that needs to be injected can be boiled down to a bean class instantiated by the container
            using <literal>new</literal>. There are plenty of cases where we need additional control. What if we need 
            to decide at runtime which implementation of a type to instantiate and inject? What if we need to inject  
            an object that is obtained by querying a service or transactional resource, for example by executing a JPA 
            query?
         </para>

         <para>
            A <emphasis>producer method</emphasis> is a method that acts as a source of bean instances. The method 
            declaration itself describes the bean and the container invokes the method to obtain an instance of the 
            bean when no instance exists in the specified context. A producer method lets the application take full 
            control of the bean instantiation process.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            A producer method is declared by annotating a method of a bean class with the <literal>@Produces</literal> 
            annotation.

   }
   
}]]></programlisting>

         <para>
            We can't write a bean class that is itself a random number. But we can certainly write a method that returns 
            a random number. By making the method a producer method, we allow the return value of the method&#8212;in this 
            case an <literal>Integer</literal>&#8212;to be injected. We can even specify a qualifier&#8212;in this case 
            <literal>@Random</literal>, a scope&#8212;which in this case defaults to <literal>@Dependent</literal>, 
            and an EL name&#8212;which in this case defaults to <literal>randomNumber</literal> according to the JavaBeans 
            property name convention. Now we can get a random number anywhere:

         <para>
            A producer method must be a non-abstract method of a managed bean class or session bean class. A producer
            method may be either static or non-static. If the bean is a session bean, the producer method must be either
            a business method of the EJB or a static method of the bean class.
         </para>

         <para>
            The bean types of a producer method depend upon the method return type:

            If the producer method has method parameters, the container will look for a bean that satisfies the type

            dependency injection.

         <title>Producer fields</title>

         <para>
            A <emphasis>producer field</emphasis> is a simpler alternative to a producer method. A producer field is 
            declared by annotating a field of a bean class with the <literal>@Produces</literal> annotation&#8212;the 
            same annotation used for producer methods.
         </para>

            The rules for determining the bean types of a producer field parallel the rules for producer methods.

         <para>
            A producer field is really just a shortcut that lets us avoid writing a useless getter method. However, 
            in addition to convenience, producer fields serve a specific purpose as an adaptor for Java EE component 
            environment injection, but to learn more about that, you'll have to wait until <xref linkend="resources"/>. 
            Because we can't wait to get to work on some examples.
