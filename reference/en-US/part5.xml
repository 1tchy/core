      Web Beans is the reference implementation of JSR-299, and is used by JBoss
      AS and Glassfish to provide CDI services for Java Enterprise Edition
      applications. Web Beans also goes beyond the environments and APIs defined
      by the JSR-299 specification and provides support for a number of other
      environments (such as a servlet container such as Tomcat, or Java SE) and
      additional APIs and modules (such as logging, XSD generation for the 
      JSR-299 XML deployment descriptors).

      If you want to get started quickly using Web Beans with JBoss AS, 
      GlassFish or Tomcat and experiment with one of the examples, take a look

      Otherwise read on for a exhaustive discussion of using Web Beans in all
      the environments and application servers it supports, as well the Web Beans
      extensions.
