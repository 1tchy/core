      Because CDI is so new, there's not yet a lot of information available online. That will change over time.
      Regardless, the CDI specification remains the authority for information on CDI. The spec is kept at around 100
      pages intentionally easy to read (don't worry, it's not like your Blue-ray player manual). You may be especially
      interested in reading it since it covers many details that we've skipped over. The spec is available on the
      <ulink src="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR-299 page</ulink> at the JCP website. Updates to the spec are
      also frequently mailed to the <ulink src="https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/weld-dev">weld-dev</ulink>
      mailing list.

      The CDI reference implementation, Weld, is being developed at the <ulink src="http://seamframework.org/Weld">Seam
      project</ulink>. The RI development team and the CDI spec lead blog at <ulink
      src="http://in.relation.to">in.relation.to</ulink>. This guide was originally based on a series of blog entries
      published there while the specification was being developed. It's probably the best source of information about
      the future of CDI, Weld and Seam.

      We encourage you to follow the <ulink src="https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/weld-dev">weld-dev</ulink>
      mailing list and to get involved in <ulink src="http://seamframework.org/Weld/Development">development</ulink>. If
      you are reading this guide, you likely have something to offer.
