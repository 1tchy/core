      The <ulink src="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR-299</ulink> specification (CDI) defines a set of 
      complementary services that help improve the structure of application code. CDI layers an enhanced lifecycle 
      and interaction model over existing Java component types, including managed beans (JavaBeans) and Enterprise 
      Java Beans. The CDI services provide:

         <para>

         <para>
            a better approach to binding <emphasis>interceptors</emphasis> to objects, along with a new kind of
            interceptor, called a <emphasis>decorator</emphasis>, that is more appropriate for use in solving 
            business problems, and
         </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            an <emphasis>SPI</emphasis> for developing portable extensions to the container.

   <para>
      The CDI services are a core aspect of the Java EE platform and include full support for Java EE modularity 
      and the Java EE component architecture. But the specification does not limit the use of CDI to the Java EE 
      environment. In the Java SE environment, the services might be provided by a standalone CDI implementation 
      like Weld (see <xref linkend="weld-se"/>), or even by a container that also implements the subset of EJB 
      defined for embedded usage by the EJB 3.1 specification. CDI is especially useful in the context of web 
      application development, but the problems it solves are general development concerns and it is therefore 
      applicable to a wide variety of application.
   </para>
  
   <para>
      An object bound to a lifecycle context is called a bean. CDI includes built-in support for several different 
      kinds of bean, including the following Java EE component types:
   </para>
   
   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>managed beans</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>EJB session beans, and</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>JAX-RS resources.</para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
    
   <para>
     Both managed beans and EJB session beans may inject other beans. But some other objects, which are not 
     themselves beans, can also make use of CDI by injecting beans. In the Java EE platform, the following 
     kinds of component may inject beans:
   </para>
    
   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>message-driven beans,</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>interceptors,</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>servlets, servlet filters and servlet event listeners,</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>JAX-WS service endpoints and handlers, and</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>JSP tag handlers and tag library event listeners.</para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  
   <para>
      CDI relieves the user of an unfamiliar API of the need to answer the following questions:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>What is the lifecycle of this object?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>How many simultaneous clients can it have?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Is it multithreaded?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>How do I get access to it from a client?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Do I need to explicitly destroy it?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            Where should I keep the reference to it when I'm not currently using it?
         </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            How can I define alternative an implementation, so that the implementation can vary 
            at deployment time?
         </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            How should I go about sharing this object between other objects?
         </para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
      The main theme of CDI, which is instrumental in removing these complexities, is <emphasis>loose-coupling with
      strong typing</emphasis>. Let's study what that phrase means.
   </para>
  
   <para>
      A bean specifies only the type and semantics of other beans it depends upon. It need not be aware of the actual
      lifecycle, concrete implementation, threading model or other clients of any bean it depends upon. Even better, the
      concrete implementation, lifecycle and threading model of a bean it depends upon may vary according to the
      deployment scenario, without affecting any client. This loose-coupling is what makes this architecture so simple,
      yet powerful. 
   </para>
  
   <para>
      Events, interceptors and decorators enhance the <emphasis>loose-coupling</emphasis> inherent in this model:
   </para>
  
   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            <emphasis>event notifications</emphasis> decouple event producers from event consumers,</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            <emphasis>interceptors</emphasis> decouple technical concerns from business logic, and</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            <emphasis>decorators</emphasis> allow business concerns to be compartmentalized.</para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  
   <para>
      What's even more powerful (and comforting) is that CDI provides all these facilities in a
      <emphasis>typesafe</emphasis> way. CDI never relies on string-based identifiers to determine how collaborating
      objects fit together. (XML is rarely used, reserved only to activate alternatives and define ordering at
      deployment time). Instead, CDI uses the typing information that is already available in the Java object model,
      then extends it with a new typing pattern, called <emphasis>qualifier annotations</emphasis>, to wire together
      beans, their dependencies, their interceptors and decorators, and their event consumers.
   </para>
  
   <para>
      CDI even provides the necessary integration points, through a comprehensive SPI, so that other kinds of object
      defined by future Java EE specifications or by third-party frameworks may be cleanly integrated with CDI, take
      advantage of the CDI services, and interact with any other kind of bean.
   </para>
  
   <para>
      CDI was influenced by a number of existing Java frameworks, including Seam, Guice and Spring. However, CDI has 
      its own, very distinct, character: more typesafe than Seam, more stateful and less XML-centric than Spring, more 
      web and enterprise-application capable than Guice. But it couldn't have been any of these without inspiration from 
      the frameworks mentioned and <emphasis>lots</emphasis> of collaboration and hard work by the JSR-299 Expert Group
      (EG).
   </para>
  
   <para>
      Finally, CDI is a <ulink src="http://jcp.org">Java Community Process</ulink> (JCP) standard. Java EE 6 requires 
      that all compliant application servers provide support for JSR-299 (even in the web profile).
