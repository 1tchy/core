"Web Beans is the reference implementation of JSR-299, and is used by JBoss "
"AS and Glassfish to provide JSR-299 services for Java Enterprise Edition "
"applications. Web Beans also goes beyond the environments and APIs defined "
"by the JSR-299 specification and provides support for a number of other "
"environments (such as a servlet container such as Tomcat, or Java SE) and "
"additional APIs and modules (such as logging, XSD generation for the JSR-299 "
"XML deployment descriptors)."
