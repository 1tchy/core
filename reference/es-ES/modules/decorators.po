"Interceptors are a powerful way to capture and separate concerns which are "
"<emphasis>orthogonal</emphasis> to the type system. Any interceptor is able "
"to intercept invocations of any Java type. This makes them perfect for "
"solving technical concerns such as transaction management and security. "
"However, by nature, interceptors are unaware of the actual semantics of the "
"events they intercept. Thus, interceptors aren't an appropriate tool for "
"separating business-related concerns."

"The reverse is true of <emphasis>decorators</emphasis>. A decorator "
"intercepts invocations only for a certain Java interface, and is therefore "
"aware of all the semantics attached to that interface. This makes decorators "
"a perfect tool for modeling some kinds of business concerns. It also means "
"that a decorator doesn't have the generality of an interceptor. Decorators "
"aren't able to solve technical concerns that cut across many disparate types."
