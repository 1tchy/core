"These techniques serve to enable loose coupling of client and server. The "
"client is no longer tightly bound to an implementation of an API, nor is it "

"attempted to provide the facilities listed above invariably did it by "
"sacrificing type safety. Web Beans is the first technology that achieves "
"this level of loose coupling in a typesafe way."
