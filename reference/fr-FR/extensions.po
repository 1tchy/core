"The example shows how objects can be interpolated into a message. This "
"interpolation is done using <emphasis>java.text.MessageFormat</emphasis>, so "
"see the JavaDoc for that class for more details. In this case, the "
"<literal>ShoppingCart</literal> should have implemented the "
"<emphasis>toString()</emphasis> method to produce a human readable value "
"that is meaningful in messages. Normally, this call would have involved "
"evaluating cart.toString() with String concatenation to produce a single "
"String argument. Thus it was necessary to surround the call with an if-"
"statement using the condition <emphasis>log.isDebugEnabled()</emphasis> to "
"avoid the expensive String concatenation if the message was not actually "
"going to be used. However, when using <literal>@Logger</literal>-injected "
"logging, the conditional test can be left out since the object arguments are "
"not evaluated unless the message is going to be logged."
