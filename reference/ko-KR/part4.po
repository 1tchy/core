"The third theme of Web Beans is <emphasis>integration</emphasis>. Web Beans "
"was designed to work in concert with other technologies, helping the "
"application developer fit the other technologies together. Web Beans is an "
"open technology. It forms a part of the Java EE ecosystem, and is itself the "
"foundation for a new ecosystem of portable extensions and integration with "
"existing frameworks and technologies."

"We've already seen how Web Beans helps integrate EJB and JSF, allowing EJBs "
"to be bound directly to JSF pages. That's just the beginning. Web Beans "
"offers the same potential to diverse other technologies, such as Business "
"Process Management engines, other Web Frameworks, and third-party component "
"models. The Java EE platform will never be able to standardize all the "
"interesting technologies that are used in the world of Java application "
"development, but Web Beans makes it easier to use the technologies which are "
"not yet part of the platform seamlessly within the Java EE environment."

"We're about to see how to take full advantage of the Java EE platform in an "
"application that uses Web Beans. We'll also briefly meet a set of SPIs that "
"are provided to support portable extensions to Web Beans. You might not ever "
"need to use these SPIs directly, but it's nice to know they are there if you "
"need them. Most importantly, you'll take advantage of them indirectly, every "
"time you use a third-party extension."
