This example is similar to its sibling "numberguess" example, but implemented 
with wicket and the wicket-weld integration.  It also follows the wicket 
standard usage of running from within eclipse with jetty.  So, for example, to 
run the app, right-click on Start.java in the project and choose "Run as Java 
Application," which will launch jetty with the example.  Then hit 
http://localhost:8080/
